This software was written in Python and JavaScript!

v0.6 
1.	New feature: excludes list option [-E inFile]
	Excludes list is a proxy list which proxytester excludes from
	testing and assumes to be bad.
2.	New feature: custom response [-RESPONSE inFile]
	Custom response is a remote page to be read and compared to. If
	the page is different then the proxy server is considered bad 
	but if the page is the same then the proxy server is good. I got
	the idea to do this because I kept getting proxy servers that 
	required some kind of credentials in an HTML format but if you
	test against a page response then it means the proxy server is
	more likely to be working. [-RESPONSE inFile] is normally used
	with [-GET url] but not always.
3.	Updated the command line documentation to reflect additional 
	features as well as improved the documentation with examples
	and more descriptions.

v0.5 Dec 6, 2009
1.	Now there is no internal configurations.  Only takes arguments.
2.	Windows binary executable now available.
3.	Can add more than 1 file as input at the end of the line instead
	of just processing a single file.
4.	New features: Optional multithreading, generate wpad.dat, set 
	proxy timeout, custom URL to test proxy servers against.  The
	custom URL is for purposes such as attempting to access a
	restricted site.
5.	Fixed bug where pressing Ctrl+C did not stop the program.


v0.4 Dec 03, 2009
1.	Now uses multithreading to process requests faster.  Processes
	4 requests at a time like a web browser.  Now it processes 
	2000 proxy servers in around 23 minutes when before it took
	hours.
2.	Added a new library for pooling thread requests.
3.	Now with timestamping.  Shows you when the script started, when 
	it ended, and how long it ran.
4.	Other minor bug fixes
5.	Updated the rules for the generated wpad.dat
6.	Updated generate_wpad.bat to remove binary pyc files


v0.3 Dec 01, 2009
1.	MAJOR bug fixes for excluding protocols in wpad-head.js. Excludes 
	weren't previously working at all!
2.	Simplified some methods by defining additional functions in 
	wpad-head.js
3.	Further optimized the process of request testing for excludes by 
	reordering when the excludes are called so proxying is now faster!
4.	Implemented advanced logging so if a user encounters errors they 
	can report it to me with sufficient information.
5.	Added a few configuration options to wpad.dat so users can easily
	download and customize it for themselves own.
6.	Added thorough documentation to wpad.dat so users can easily 
	understand the options
7.	Created some bookmarklets to assist mining a list of proxies from 
	online sources which are located in the lists folder.

v0.2 Dec 01, 2009
1.	Added a new option RESTRICTED_URL to check-status-proxy-address.py
2.	Spacing change to wpad-foot.js

v0.1 Nov 30, 2009
1.	First Release
